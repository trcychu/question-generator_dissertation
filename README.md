# question-generator_dissertation

This is a dissertation project about generating questions based on bank contracts with NLP using T5 and BART pretrained model.

The related files are all uploaded into github, except the model files, because they are too large to be uploaded, so I put them here:

We collected our own dataset from 2 resources: FAQs crawled from 20 bank websites, and manually constructed questions from parsed PDF files of 10 bank contracts. 

webscrape(1).ipynb is the code for crawling. After the qa pairs were collected, we deal with personal pronoun problem in questions and extracted context from questions and add it to answers as our context manually.

pdf_parser.ipynb is the code for parsing the contracts pdf files. After the paragraphs were split, we manually generated questions and answers based on paragraphs, and combined the short paragraphs into a whole context if they had the same semantic meaning.

data_v4.csv is the final data after cleaned.

run_model.ipynb is the code for fine tuning the models.

The .csv files beginning with "result" are the predicted questions generated by models before and after fine tune.

The evaluation.ipynb is the code for evaluating models.
